## Approach

We identified candidates with dual expertise in traditional banking operations and digital transformation, focusing on leaders who had successfully managed post-merger integrations.

- Conducted comprehensive stakeholder interviews across both legacy organizations
- Mapped critical success factors for the integration timeline
- Evaluated candidates on both financial acumen and change management capabilities

The selected CFO brought experience from three previous successful bank mergers and a track record of implementing digital finance platforms.

## Implementation

The placement process focused on cultural alignment and integration capabilities:

- **Week 1-2**: Stakeholder alignment and role specification
- **Week 3-4**: Candidate sourcing and initial screenings  
- **Week 5-6**: Board presentations and reference checks
- **Week 7**: Offer negotiation and acceptance

Our candidate assessment included case studies on similar integration challenges, ensuring the selected leader could navigate the complex regulatory and operational landscape.
