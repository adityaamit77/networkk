## Approach

We sought leaders with deep omnichannel retail experience, focusing on candidates who had successfully integrated digital and physical retail operations.

- Evaluated track records in retail technology implementation
- Assessed customer experience design capabilities
- Tested understanding of supply chain and inventory optimization

The selected leader brought experience from transforming two major retail chains, with expertise in both customer-facing technology and backend operations.

## Omnichannel Integration

The placement delivered seamless shopping experiences:

- **Unified Inventory**: Real-time visibility across all channels and locations
- **Click & Collect**: Same-day pickup options driving foot traffic
- **Mobile App**: Personalized shopping with location-based offers
- **Customer Data Platform**: 360-degree view of customer journey

The integration required coordinating across IT, supply chain, store operations, and marketing teams - leveraging the leader's cross-functional expertise.

## Digital-Physical Synergy

Key innovations that unified the customer experience:

- **Virtual Try-On**: AR technology for fashion and home goods
- **Store Associates as Personal Shoppers**: Digital tools for enhanced service
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time optimization across channels
- **Social Commerce**: Instagram and WhatsApp shopping integration

The commerce head's retail background ensured technology implementations enhanced rather than replaced the human touch that customers valued.
