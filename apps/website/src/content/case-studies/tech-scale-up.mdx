## Approach

We mapped the client's product goals to leadership traits and leveraged our executive network to source proven engineering heads within days.

- Benchmarked role expectations with industry peers.
- Presented a curated shortlist in one week.
- Facilitated structured interviews and compensation alignment.

By partnering closely with the board and founders, we ensured cultural alignment and rapid onboarding.
